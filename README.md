# applegpuinfo

Goal: In one hour, finish a mini-package and command-line tool for querying Apple GPU device parameters.

Results: I spent 57 minutes finishing the file that wraps the `AppleGPUDevice` structure. I asked GPT-4 to generate the tests and command-line tool. I renamed the command-line tool from `applegpuinfo` to `gpuinfo` according to the AI's suggestion. Finally, I congratulated it and asked for it to leave a comment to users on the README. That triggered a safeguard and it quit the conversation. The stop time was 1 hour, 25 minutes.
